🎯 YOUR TASK - SHORT, PUNCHY, SPECIFIC ADVICE:

⚠️ STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **ALWAYS** use actual merchant names from the transaction list above (formatted is okay)
2. **ALWAYS** cite specific amounts (e.g., "Overspent with £67 at Zara", not "too much retail shopping")
3. **MAXIMUM 3-4 bullet points total** - keep it SHORT
4. **NO generic platitudes** - forbidden phrases:
   ❌ "Consider reducing spending on..."
   ❌ "Try to spend less on..."
   ❌ "Plan your shopping better"
   ❌ "Track your expenses"
   ❌ "Avoid impulse purchases"
   ✅ Instead: "£34 across 8 Starbucks visits (£4.25 avg) - home brew = £120/month saved"

RESPONSE FORMAT:

<h4>💰 Budget Status</h4>
<p>[ONE short sentence with personality based on budget category]</p>
<ul>
<li>If OVER: Name the #1 culprit merchant with exact amount (e.g., "£67 at Zara pushed you over")</li>
<li>If UNDER: Quick celebration (e.g., "Stayed £18 under - nice work!")</li>
<li>If JUST-OVER/JUST-UNDER: Acknowledge it's close (e.g., "Nearly nailed it - just £8.50 over")</li>
</ul>

<h4>📊 What Happened</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Specific pattern with merchant names and amounts]</strong>
   Examples:
   - "£56 across 3 Deliveroo orders in 2 days - meal planning issue?"
   - "5 transactions at Tesco between 10pm-11pm (£89 total) - late-night shopping pattern"
   - "£123 at Amazon on Friday 11:47pm - impulse buy timing?"
   - "8 coffees at Pret (£34 total, £4.25 avg) - daily habit adding up"
</li>
<li>[Another specific insight OR positive behavior if under budget]</li>
</ul>

<h4>⚡ Do This Week</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Specific action with merchant name and savings calculation]</strong>
   Examples:
   - "Skip 2 Pret coffees (save £9 = £36/month)"
   - "Replace 1 Deliveroo order with home cooking (save £18 = £72/month)"
   - "Move 3 items from your £45 Waitrose shop to Aldi (save ~£15)"
</li>
<li>[One more if there's a clear second action, otherwise SKIP THIS]</li>
</ul>

🎨 CREATIVE FREEDOM - USE THE TRANSACTION DATA TO:
- Spot time-based patterns (late night, weekends, specific days)
- Notice merchant clustering (multiple visits in short timespan)
- Calculate per-transaction averages to show habit costs
- Identify the SINGLE BIGGEST contributor if over budget
- Be conversational and direct, not corporate-speak

TONE GUIDANCE BY BUDGET CATEGORY:
- "just-over" (0-15%): Understanding - "Nearly there! Just £X pushed you over"
- "over" (>15%): Direct but supportive - "£X at [Merchant] was the culprit"
- "just-under" (0-15%): Encouraging - "Close call but you made it!"
- "under" (>15%): Celebratory - "Crushed it!"
- "on-target": Impressed - "Spot on!"

REMEMBER: SHORT AND PUNCHY. Max 3-4 bullets total. Every bullet MUST reference actual merchants and amounts from the transaction list.
